The Interpreter pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a grammar
for a simple language, and implements an interpreter for that language. It allows
a client to specify operations in the language, and the interpreter executes those operations.

One strength of the Interpreter pattern is that it allows a client to define new
operations simply by defining a new class that implements the appropriate interface.
Another strength is that the interpreter can be implemented to optimize execution,
such as by using an abstract syntax tree.

A weakness of the Interpreter pattern is that the interpreter can become complex and hard
to maintain if the language is large or has many operations. Additionally, the use of the
Interpreter pattern can make the client code harder to read, as it may be difficult to understand
the language being used.
