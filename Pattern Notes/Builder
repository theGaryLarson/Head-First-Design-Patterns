The Builder pattern is a creational design pattern that allows for the creation of complex
objects in a step-by-step manner. It separates the construction of an object from its representation,
allowing for more flexible and efficient creation of objects.

Strengths:
allows for the creation of complex objects
in a step-by-step manner, making the process of object creation more flexible and easier to understand.
Additionally, the Builder pattern allows for the creation of objects with different representations, as
the construction of the object is separate from its representation.

Weaknesses:

Code complexity - The Builder pattern can result in a large number of small classes,
which can make the codebase more complex and harder to understand.

Increased verbosity -
The Builder pattern can also lead to more verbose code, as it requires the creation
of multiple classes and methods for the construction of an object.

Limited use cases - The Builder pattern is most useful when building complex objects with
many optional parameters. If the object being built is simple and does not have many optional
parameters, the Builder pattern may be unnecessary and add unnecessary complexity to the codebase.

Decreased performance -
The Builder pattern may also result in decreased performance, as it requires
the creation of multiple objects and method calls to build a single object. This can
be especially noticeable in cases where the object being built is simple and does not
require many optional parameters.
