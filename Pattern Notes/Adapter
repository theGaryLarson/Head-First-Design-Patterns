The Adapter pattern is a structural design pattern that allows two unrelated classes to work together by converting
the interface of one class into an interface expected by the other class. It is often used to make existing classes
work with others without modifying their source code. An example is Adapting legacy code to fit into new systems.

The Adapter pattern has the following strengths:

1. It allows you to reuse existing classes that may not be compatible with the rest of your code without modifying
their source code.

2. It promotes loose coupling between classes, making it easier to change the implementation of an adapter without
affecting the client code.

3. It is a simple and straightforward pattern to implement.


The Adapter pattern has the following weaknesses:

1. It can introduce additional complexity to your codebase, as it requires the creation of additional classes.

2. It may not be as efficient as using inheritance to achieve the same result, as it requires more method calls.
