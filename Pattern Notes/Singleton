The Singleton pattern is a design pattern that ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global
access point to it. It is useful when we need to have a single instance of a class that is shared among different
objects or components in an application.

One way to implement the Singleton pattern in Java is to make the class responsible for creating its own instance
a private static inner class. This inner class can be used to hold the single instance of the outer class.
