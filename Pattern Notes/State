The State pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when
its internal state changes. It involves defining a "context" class that represents the current state
of an object, and one or more "state" classes that define the behavior for different states of the
context. The context delegates its behavior to the current state object, which can be changed at
runtime to alter the behavior of the context.

One of the main strengths of the State pattern is that it allows you to encapsulate state-specific behavior in
separate classes, making it easier to add new states or change the behavior of existing states without modifying
the context class. This can make your code more maintainable and flexible, as you can add or change states without
affecting the rest of the system.

However, one potential weakness of the State pattern is that it can result in a large number of classes, especially
if you have a large number of states and state-specific behavior. This can make your code more complex and harder
to understand.
