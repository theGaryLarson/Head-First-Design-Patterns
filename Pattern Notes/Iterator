The Iterator pattern is a design pattern that allows a client object to iterate over a collection of
objects in a uniform manner, without the need to know the underlying implementation of the collection.
It allows the client to access elements of a collection sequentially, without exposing the underlying
representation of the collection.

One of the main strengths of the Iterator pattern is that it decouples the collection from the iteration over
its elements. This allows the client to iterate over the elements of the collection without needing to know the
specifics of the collection's implementation. Additionally, the Iterator pattern allows multiple iterators to
be created for the same collection, allowing multiple clients to iterate over the collection simultaneously.

One potential weakness of the Iterator pattern is that it can add complexity to the design of a system, as it
requires the creation of additional classes to implement the iterator.
