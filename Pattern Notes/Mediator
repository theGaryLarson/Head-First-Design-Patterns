The Mediator pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows communication between objects through a mediator
object, rather than allowing objects to communicate directly. This can be useful in cases where the objects have
complex or changing relationships, as the mediator can handle communication between the objects and abstract away
the details of their interactions.

One strength of the Mediator pattern is that it can reduce the complexity and coupling between objects, making
the system more flexible and maintainable. It can also promote the Single Responsibility Principle, as the mediator
can handle communication between objects rather than each object having to be aware of and communicate with all other
objects.

However, one potential weakness of the Mediator pattern is that it can introduce an additional layer of indirection,
which can make the system more difficult to understand and debug.
