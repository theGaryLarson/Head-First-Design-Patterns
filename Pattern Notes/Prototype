The prototype pattern is a creational design pattern that allows an object to be copied or
cloned to create a new instance of that object. This is useful when creating an object is
expensive or requires a lot of resources, as the prototype pattern allows you to create a new
object by copying an existing object rather than creating a new one from scratch.

One strength of the prototype pattern is that it can improve performance by reducing the number of
costly object creations. It can also allow for greater flexibility in object creation, as the prototype
object can be easily modified to create different variations of the object.

A weakness of the prototype pattern is that it can be more complex to implement, as the object
being cloned must be made cloneable and the cloning process must be properly implemented.
