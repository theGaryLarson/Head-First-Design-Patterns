The Observer pattern is a design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents,
called observers, and automatically notifies them of any state changes. This allows the observers to be notified when
the state of the subject changes and to update themselves accordingly.

The main strengths of the Observer pattern are:

It allows for loose coupling between the subject and its observers, as the subject does not need to know the specifics
of how its state changes are handled by the observers.
It allows for a simple and efficient way to broadcast state changes to multiple observers.
It allows for the addition and removal of observers at runtime, which can be useful in dynamic systems.

Some potential weaknesses of the Observer pattern include:

It can lead to performance issues if there are a large number of observers, as each observer will need to be notified
of state changes.
It can result in complex and hard-to-debug systems if the observers are not implemented correctly.
It can result in unnecessary updates if the observers are not designed to filter out unnecessary updates.

Eager or Lazy:

In the observer pattern, the subject typically maintains a list of observers that are interested in receiving
updates from the subject. When the subject's state changes, it notifies all of its registered observers by calling
the update method on each of them.

There are two main approaches to implementing this notification process:

Eager update:
 In this approach, the subject immediately sends updates to all of its registered observers as soon as its state
 changes. This can be efficient in cases where the number of observers is small and the cost of sending an update
 is low.

Lazy update:
In this approach, the subject defers sending updates to its observers until they specifically request an update.
This can be more efficient in cases where the number of observers is large and the cost of sending updates is high,
because it allows the subject to avoid sending updates to observers that are not interested in receiving them.

It's worth noting that the choice between eager and lazy update depends on the specific requirements and constraints
of the application. There is no one-size-fits-all solution, and the most appropriate approach may vary depending on
the context.
