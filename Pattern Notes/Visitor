The Visitor pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to add new behavior
to existing class hierarchy without modifying the classes. It does this by separating
the new behavior into a separate class, called a visitor, and having the existing
classes accept the visitor.

One of the main strengths of the Visitor pattern is that it allows you to
add new behavior to existing classes without having to modify the classes themselves.
This can be particularly useful when you want to add behavior to a large class hierarchy
and don't want to modify each class individually.

Another strength of the Visitor pattern is that it promotes the separation of concerns.
The existing class hierarchy is responsible for storing and organizing data, while the
visitor is responsible for performing operations on that data. This separation of
responsibilities can make the code easier to understand and maintain.

On the other hand, one potential weakness of the Visitor pattern is that it can make the code more
complex, as it involves creating additional classes and methods. Additionally, the Visitor pattern
can be less efficient than other approaches, as it requires extra method calls to traverse the class
hierarchy.
