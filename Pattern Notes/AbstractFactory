The Abstract Factory pattern is a creational design pattern that provides
an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without
specifying their concrete classes. It does this by separating the creation
of objects into a separate factory class, which creates the objects according
to a set of rules defined in an interface.

One of the main strengths of the Abstract Factory pattern is that it allows
you to create a set of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
This can be particularly useful when you want to create objects that belong to a
specific family or theme, as it allows you to easily change the set of objects
being created without modifying the client code.

Another strength of the Abstract Factory pattern is that it promotes the separation
of concerns. The factory class is responsible for creating the objects, while the
client code is responsible for using them. This separation of responsibilities can
make the code easier to understand and maintain.

On the other hand, one potential weakness of the Abstract Factory pattern is
that it can make the code more complex, as it involves creating additional classes
and methods. Additionally, the Abstract Factory pattern can be less efficient than
other approaches, as it requires extra method calls to create objects.
