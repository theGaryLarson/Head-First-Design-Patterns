The Chain of Responsibility pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows a request to be
passed along a chain of objects. The pattern allows a series of objects to attempt to handle a
request or command, and decouples the sender and receiver of the request.

Strengths:

It promotes loose coupling, as the objects in the chain are only aware of their immediate successors, rather
than the entire chain. This makes it easier to add, remove, or rearrange objects in the chain without affecting
the overall system.

It allows for flexibility, as the chain can be modified at runtime, allowing new behavior to be added
or existing behavior to be modified.

Weaknesses:

It can be difficult to debug, as it can be difficult to determine which object in the chain is responsible
for handling a particular request.

It can also result in performance issues if the chain is too long or if there are too many requests being processed.
