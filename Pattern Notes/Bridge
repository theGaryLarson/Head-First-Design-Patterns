The Bridge design pattern is a structural design pattern that separates an abstraction
from its implementation so that the two can vary independently. It is used to decouple
an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can evolve independently.

One of the main strengths of the Bridge pattern is that it allows for the separation
of an abstraction from its implementation, which can be particularly useful when the
implementation needs to be changed or updated frequently. This can make it easier to
maintain and extend the code.

Another strength of the Bridge pattern is that it can improve the efficiency of the
code by allowing the implementation to be optimized independently of the abstraction.

A weakness of the Bridge pattern is that it can add an additional level of complexity
to the code, as it requires the creation of both an abstraction and an implementation.
This can make the code more difficult to understand and maintain.
