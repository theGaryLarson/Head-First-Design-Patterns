The Composite pattern is a design pattern that allows a client object to treat a group of objects in the
same way as a single object. It allows a client to perform operations on individual objects and on
collections of objects uniformly, by abstracting the implementation details of the individual objects and
the collections into a common interface.

One of the main strengths of the Composite pattern is that it allows clients to manipulate objects in a hierarchical
structure in a uniform manner. This allows clients to treat both individual objects and collections of objects in the
same way, without needing to know the specifics of the objects' implementations. Additionally, the Composite pattern
allows clients to manipulate objects in a tree-like structure, which can be useful for representing hierarchical
relationships between objects.

One potential weakness of the Composite pattern is that it can add complexity to the design of a system, as it
requires the creation of additional classes to implement the composite and leaf objects.
