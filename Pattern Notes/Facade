The Facade design pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to
a complex system of classes, libraries, or frameworks. It allows clients to access the functionality
of the complex system without having to be concerned with its underlying implementation details.

One of the main strengths of the Facade pattern is that it helps to reduce the complexity of the client
code and improve the usability of the complex system by providing a unified, high-level interface to its
various components. This can make it easier for developers to understand and work with the system, as well
as make it more accessible to users.

Another strength of the Facade pattern is that it can decouple the client code from the implementation details
of the complex system, which can make it easier to maintain and extend the system over time.

One potential weakness of the Facade pattern is that it can add an additional layer of indirection to the system,
which can increase the overall complexity and make it more difficult to understand and debug. It can also make it
more difficult to modify the underlying system, as changes may require updates to the Facade as well.
