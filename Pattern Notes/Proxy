The Proxy pattern is a design pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder object for another object and
controls access to it. The proxy object has the same interface as the original object and can be used in place
of it.The proxy can intercept requests and perform additional actions before or after forwarding the request to
the original object.

One common use of the Proxy pattern is to provide a remote proxy, which represents a object located in a different
address space and communicates with it using a network. This can be useful for improving the performance of an
application by reducing the number of network round trips, or for providing access to a remote object to clients
that are not on the same machine.

Strengths:

The Proxy pattern allows you to provide a placeholder for an object, which can be used to control access to it
and add additional functionality. It can improve the performance of an application by reducing the number of
network round trips or by providing a local representation of a remote object.

Weaknesses:

The Proxy pattern can add an additional level of indirection to the application, which can make it more complex
and harder to understand.
It can also result in a performance overhead if the proxy adds a significant amount of additional functionality.
